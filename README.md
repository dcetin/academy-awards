## Dataset details
Source: Academy Awards Database [[1]](http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/) for films, winners and nominees, Wikipedia for birthdates of the artists [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor), [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress), [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director) and dates of the award ceremonies [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Academy_Awards_ceremonies).

Some directors (William A. Wellman, Francis Ford Coppola and Alejandro G. Iñárritu) and actors (Laurence Olivier, Daniel Day-Lewis) were credited differently throughout years, so their respective entries were merged as one. 

There were a couple of times where films with directing teams have nominated for the award. These four films listed below have multiple entries in the dataset, where the names of the respective directors were marked with an asterisk at the end.

- Warren Beatty (born March 30, 1937) and Buck Henry (born December 9, 1930) for Heaven Can Wait in 1978.
- Robert Wise (born September 10, 1914) and Jerome Robbins (born October 11, 1918) for West Side Story in 1961
- Joel Coen (born November 29, 1954) and Ethan Coen (born September 21, 1957) for No Country for Old Men in 2007 and True Grit in 2010.

The 2nd Academy Awards is unique in being the only occasion where there were no official nominees. Subsequent research by AMPAS has resulted in a list of unofficial or *de facto* nominees, based on records of which films were evaluated by the judges.

Joan Crawford's birthdate is uncertain but most modern biographers cite 1904 as the most likely year [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford#cite_note-birthyear-15).
